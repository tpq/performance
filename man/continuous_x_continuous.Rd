\title{Performance for Two Continuous Variables}
\usage{
continuous_x_continuous(a, b)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{A numeric vector representing the first continuous variable.}

\item{b}{A numeric vector representing the second continuous variable.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the computed performance measures.
}
\description{
The \code{continuous_x_continuous} function calculates various performance
 measures for paired continuous variables.
}
\details{
The function performs the following calculations:
\itemize{
\item Pearson correlation coefficient and p-value.
\item Kendall's tau correlation coefficient and p-value.
\item Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and p-value.
\item Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between \code{a} and \code{b}.
\item Mean Squared Error (MSE) between \code{a} and \code{b}.
}

\examples{
# Example data
a <- c(1.2, 2.3, 3.1, 4.5, 5.7)
b <- c(1.0, 2.7, 3.0, 4.2, 5.8)

# Compute performance measures for paired continuous variables
result <- continuous_x_continuous(a, b)
print(result)
